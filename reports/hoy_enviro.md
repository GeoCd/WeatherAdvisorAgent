### Environmental Conditions Report for New York

**Date:** 2025-11-17

**Summary:**

Currently, New York is experiencing cool temperatures with a real feel below freezing due to the wind. There is a **moderate** risk associated with the cold and a **high** risk due to the strong winds. Air quality information is not available, so its risk is marked as **unknown**. The overall environmental risk for outdoor activities is **moderate**.

**Detailed Risks:**

*   **Heat Risk:** Low
*   **Cold Risk:** Moderate
*   **Wind Risk:** High
*   **Air Quality Risk:** Unknown

**Rationale:**

The temperature is 4.1°C, but the apparent temperature is -1.8°C. This significant difference, along with a wind speed of 18.4 m/s, contributes to a moderate cold risk. The high wind speed is the primary concern, posing a significant risk for outdoor activities. Since air quality data is missing, we cannot assess that risk.

**Recommendations:**

Given the moderate cold risk and high wind risk, it is advisable to:

*   **Dress in warm layers:** Pay close attention to protecting extremities like hands and head from the cold.
*   **Wear windproof clothing:** This will help mitigate the impact of the strong winds and the lower apparent temperature.
*   **Limit prolonged outdoor exposure:** Especially if you are sensitive to cold or wind.
*   **Stay informed about air quality:** If air quality data becomes available, check it before engaging in strenuous outdoor activities.

Be mindful of these conditions if you plan to go for a run today. It might be a good idea to shorten your run or choose a different time if possible.
